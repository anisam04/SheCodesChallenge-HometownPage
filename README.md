# SheCodesChallenge-Hometown Landing Page

The Challenge was to create a Landing Page with the theme: Your Hometown.
It was only possbile to submit a valid and single HTML file, including the content related to the challenge theme. 
The HTML file must contain the HTML code, CSS code, and, optionally, JavaScript code. 
It's only possible to submit one HTML file, so multi-page websites are not admittable.

I used the following to make my site stand out:
- CSS Animation for waves
- Carousel
- Image map to create multiple links on one image
- Inline styling
- Bootstrap
